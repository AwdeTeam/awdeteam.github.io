# Procedure Design

## Organization
If the lists and trees here seem disorderly or hard-to-navigate, consider re-organizing them!

## Procedures
Before doing anything, check to see if there's a procedure here for it. If so, follow the procedure.
If not, consider writing one!

A procedure is a process that can be followed to produce an outcome. It should provide enough
information for the user to understand what they're doing if they want it and it should provide
resources (usually links) as needed.

Procedures can be included in other procedures, so if the same steps are repeated in multiple
procedures, consider factoring out the common elements to a new micro-procedure.

## Templates
Before writing a procedure, check to see if there's a relevant template for it. Use the most
specific template that applies. If there's no relevant template or the most relevant template
doesn't seem specific enough, consider making one!

A template is a shell of a procedure. Instead of writing out a new procedure from scratch, a
template allows you to build standards by enforcing conventions.
