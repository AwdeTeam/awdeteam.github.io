# AWDE Team Action System Control (ATAS)
ATAS is a group metacortex system centered on this website. It's an attempt at formalizing and
systematizing group activity and management. Once the building process is done this will be an easy
place for member to go so they can see what all is going on.

> Era: [**Extremism**](http://blog.ezyang.com/2012/11/extremist-programming/); in these early stages
> we will intentionally use extremist principles to help organize things. This era will end once we
> have enough confidence in the system to relax the rules.

# Overview

## Activities

## [Groups](groups)
Groups meet on some regular (or semi-regular) schedule and have a topic or main activity but no
definite goals. Our currently active groups are

  + nothing! this should change!

## [Projects](projects)
Projects are more limited in timeframe than groups. They have clear goals set and agreed on by the
members when the project starts, as well as a set number of meetings planned in advance. Our
currently active projects are

  + [Radiopunk Mini-Campaign](projects/games/radiopunk)

## [Events](events)
Events are the wildcard activities, festivals, and other random nonsense we get up to. Upcoming
events include:

  + none! add some!

## [Procedures](procedures)

These are simple procedures designed to standardize common AWDE activities, mainly centered around
starting groups, campaigns, projects, or other things (and thus targeted at leaders).
