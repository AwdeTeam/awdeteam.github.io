# AWDE Team Action System Control (ATAS)
ATAS is a group metacortex system centered on this website. It's an attempt at formalizing and
systematizing group activity and management. Once the building process is done this will be an easy
place for member to go so they can see what all is going on.

> have enough confidence in the system to relax the rules.

# Design

## Organization
If the lists and trees here seem disorderly or hard-to-navigate, consider re-organizing them!

## Procedures
Before doing anything, check to see if there's a procedure here for it. If so, follow the procedure.
If not, consider writing one!

A procedure is a process that can be followed to produce an outcome. It should provide enough
information for the user to understand what they're doing if they want it and it should provide
resources (usually links) as needed.

## Templates
Before writing a procedure, check to see if there's a relevant template for it. Use the most
specific template that applies. If there's no relevant template or the most relevant template
doesn't seem specific enough, consider making one!

A template is a shell of a procedure. Instead of writing out a new procedure from scratch, a
template allows you to build standards by enforcing conventions.
